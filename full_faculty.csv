This work has led directly to several new cryptographic concepts, including: “Remotely-Keyed Encryption,” which allows the use of inexpensive, low-bandwidth secure hardware to protect high-bandwidth communication and stored data, “Atomic Proxy Cryptography,” which allows re-encryption by untrusted third parties, and “Master-Key Encryption,” which provides a systematic way to design (and study) ciphers with built-in “back doors.”    I am especially interested in the use of encryption to protect insecure systems such as the Internet. I was a designer of swipe, a predecessor of the now standard IPSEC protocol for protecting Internet traffic. Another project, CFS, investigated and demonstrated the feasibility of including encryption as file system service.    Recently, I’ve applied cryptologic techniques to other areas, including the analysis of physical security systems; this work yielded a powerful and practical attack against virtually all commonly used master-keyed mechanical locks.    Trust Management    I coined the term, and am one of the inventors of, Trust Management, which provides the abstract layer in which a system decides whether to allow some potentially dangerous action. This work has led to two trust management languages, KeyNote and PolicyMaker, that provide tools for specifying policy, delegating authority, and controlling access. In addition to providing a useful framework for studying and proving security properties of distributed systems, our tools have been used to build powerful policy control mechanisms into several important applications, including the OpenBSD IPSEC implementation.    Technology and Public Policy    Cryptology and computer security have important relationships to vital areas of public policy, and my work has touched on these in several ways. In 1994, I discovered a serious flaw in the US Government’s “Clipper” encryption system, which had been proposed as a mechanism for the public to encrypt their data in a way that would still allow access by law enforcement. I have edited several influential reports on encryption policy, including the 1998 study of “key escrow” systems that demonstrated that such systems are inherently less secure and more expensive than systems without such a feature. This work contributed to the recent shift in U.S. encryption policy. More recently, I have been active in the analysis of the FBI’s “Carnivore” Internet wiretap system. I have testified before various comittees of the US Congress and European Parliament several times, providing technical perspective on the problems surrounding law enforcement and intelligence access to communications traffic and computer data.

In December 2017, American Lawyer magazine named him The Litigator of the Year; he was chosen from all the lawyers in the United States. At the age of 49, he has also already argued more Supreme Court cases in U.S. history than has any minority attorney, recently breaking the record held by Thurgood Marshall. Neal has argued major Supreme Court cases involving a variety of issues, such as his successful defense of the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, his victorious defense of former Attorney General John Ashcroft for alleged abuses in the war on terror, his unanimous victory against 8 states who sued the nation’s leading power plants for contributing to global warming, his attack on Donald Trump’s “travel ban,” and a variety of other matters. As Acting Solicitor General, Katyal was responsible for representing the federal government of the United States in all appellate matters before the U.S. Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals throughout the nation. Neal has orally argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court of the United States, with 37 of them in the last decade, and more arguments upcoming this Term. In the 2016-17 Term alone, Neal argued 7 cases in 6 separate arguments at the Supreme Court, far more than any other advocate in the nation.

While teaching at Georgetown, Katyal won Hamdan v. Rumsfeld in the United States Supreme Court, a case that challenged the policy of military trials at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station, Cuba. The Supreme Court sided with him by a 5-3 vote, finding that President Bush’s tribunals violated the constitutional separation of powers, domestic military law, and international law. As former Solicitor General and Duke law professor Walter Dellinger put it “Hamdan is simply the most important decision on presidential power and the rule of law ever. Ever.” An expert in matters of constitutional law, Katyal has embraced his theoretical work as the platform for practical consequences in the federal courts. Katyal previously served as National Security Adviser in the U.S. Justice Department and was commissioned by President Clinton to write a report on the need for more legal pro bono work. He also served as Vice President Al Gore’s co-counsel in the Supreme Court election dispute of 2000, and represented the Deans of most major private law schools in the landmark University of Michigan affirmative-action case Grutter v.

Her most recent book, a first in its field, is Women’s Human Rights: The International and Comparative Law Casebook (2008), with an on-line documentary supplement, RossRights.com. She co-authored one of the first two casebooks on women’s rights issues, Sex Discrimination and the Law: Causes and Remedies(1975), as well as Sex Discrimination and the Law: History, Practice, and Theory(1996), focusing on remedies for sex-based employment discrimination.In other books and articles, she has written about parental leave, sexual harassment, domestic violence, polygyny as a violation of women’s human rights, and the role of fact-finding in advancing women’s human rights. She served as Reporter to the Uniform Laws Commission’s Drafting Committee for a Uniform Act on Prevention of and Remedies for Human Trafficking, from 2011 to 2013, when the Act was adopted.She was also Co-Chair of the Special Committee on Gender for the D.C. Circuit Task Force on Gender, Race, and Ethnic Bias, which met from 1992-1995 and published its report in 1996.She served as Co-Chair of the Campaign to End Discrimination against Pregnant Workers from 1976 to 1978;in that capacity, she testified before Congress for enactment of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, which was needed to reverse the Supreme Court’s holding in General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125 (1976), that discrimination against pregnant workers was not prohibited sex discrimination within the meaning of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.She was also a leading advocate for enactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, testifying before Congress and helping to ensure that it provided leave to both women and men and not just women, as originally envisioned.  Before joining the faculty in 1983, she was Special Counsel for Sex Discrimination Litigation at the U.S. Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, and before that the Clinical Director of the ACLU’s Women’s Rights Project.Other experience included work at the General Counsel’s office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and a year of private practice with Bellamy, Blank, Goodman, Kelly, Ross and Stanley.During those years, she also taught early women and the law courses as an adjunct at GW, NYU, Rutgers, and Columbia Law Schools;at GW, she was also a visiting professor. At the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, her litigation resulted in Kentucky women prisoners gaining the right to equal vocational training programs with men and in thousands of Rhode Island mothers receiving more than $2,000,000 to compensate them for the state having denied them the PDA-required paid sick leave other workers received under a Rhode Island statute. Her ACLU Women’s Rights Project litigation helped establish women’s right to equal pension benefits with men, both at the federal trial level (Peters v. Wayne State University in 1979) and Supreme Court (Los Angeles Department of Water &Power v. Manhart in 1978).While a Hays Civil Liberties Fellow at N.Y.U. Law School, she wrote the ACLU amicus brief for Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., the Supreme Court decision that employers could not refuse to hire mothers –when they hired fathers –of pre-school age children, the Court’s first Title VII sex discrimination case. Before law school, she was a Peace Corps volunteer in Ivory Coast (1965-1967), and her work with the International Women’s Human Rights Clinic has enabled her to work now with many prominent African women’s rights lawyers to advance women’s rights in their countries.Using human rights projects prepared by Clinic students under her leadership, Clinic partners have succeeded in winning new laws prohibiting domestic violence and sex-based employment discrimination in both Ghana and Uganda.In addition, in Ghana, they won new laws prohibiting trafficking and in Uganda, female genital mutilation.Victorious lawsuits in the Uganda Constitutional Court struck down sex-discriminatory laws concerning divorce (husbands could divorce for adultery, but wives could not), criminal adultery (married women could be prosecuted for adultery with an unmarried man, but married men were immune from such prosecution for adultery with an unmarried woman), and inheritance (e.g., intestacy provisions denied the surviving widow, but not the widower, ownership of the matrimonial home and lands;ownership was granted instead to the eldest son).In Tanzania, the Clinic and the Women’s Legal Aid Centre partnered to win a victory before the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2015;it ruled that Tanzania’s customary law denying widows any inheritance, prohibiting women from inheriting clan land or administering estates, and granting sons much more personal property than daughters violated the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  In 2019, the Clinic learned that its partners in Kenya and Eswatini (formerly, Swaziland) had won important court victories with the help of the Clinic’s work.  In Kenya, a High Court struck down laws giving unwed fathers the “optional paternity” right to avoid all financial responsibility for their children; the Court ruled that under Kenya’s Constitution, “fathers and mothers have equal responsibility to a child they bear, and this responsibility is not left to the volition of the man or woman.”  And in Eswatini, another High Court held that the common law rule that married women are subject to their husband’s marital power, and the statutory rule that “African” wives should be subject to their husband’s Swazi marital power unless they opted out before marriage, discriminated against married women and offended their constitutional rights to dignity and equality.  Both rules gave husbands the right to make unilateral decisions over property and other matters; they treated adult women as minor children. ","[Professor Ross teaches International and Comparative Law on Women’s Human Rights and is the Director of the International Women’s Human Rights Clinic, which she founded in 1998., In the Clinic, students work to advance women’s human rights through litigation, legislation, and human rights reporting in partnership with women’s NGOs in many developing countries, especially in Africa., She was also Director of the Sex Discrimination Clinic, where students litigated on behalf of victims of sex-based employment discrimination and domestic violence (1983-1998)., Finally, she started and served as Director of the Women’s Law and Public Policy Fellowship Program (1983-1998) and its Leadership and Advocacy for Women in Africa Program (1993-1998)., Her most recent book, a first in its field, is Women’s Human Rights:, The International and Comparative Law Casebook (2008), with an on-line documentary supplement, RossRights.com., She co-authored one of the first two casebooks on women’s rights issues, Sex Discrimination and the Law: Causes and Remedies(1975), as well as Sex Discrimination and the Law: History, Practice, and Theory(1996), focusing on remedies for sex-based employment discrimination., In other books and articles, she has written about parental leave, sexual harassment, domestic violence, polygyny as a violation of women’s human rights, and the role of fact-finding in advancing women’s human rights., She served as Reporter to the Uniform Laws Commission’s Drafting Committee for a Uniform Act on Prevention of and Remedies for Human Trafficking, from 2011 to 2013, when the Act was adopted., She was also Co-Chair of the Special Committee on Gender for the D.C. Circuit Task Force on Gender, Race, and Ethnic Bias, which met from 1992-1995 and published its report in 1996., She served as Co-Chair of the Campaign to End Discrimination against Pregnant Workers from 1976 to 1978;in that capacity, she testified before Congress for enactment of the Pregnancy Discrimination, Act of 1978, which was needed to reverse the Supreme Court’s holding in General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125 (1976), that discrimination against pregnant workers was not prohibited sex discrimination within the meaning of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act., She was also a leading advocate for enactment of the Family and Medical Leave, Act of 1993, testifying before Congress and helping to ensure that it provided leave to both women and men and not just women, as originally envisioned.  , Before joining the faculty in 1983, she was Special Counsel for Sex Discrimination Litigation at the U.S. Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, and before that the Clinical Director of the ACLU’s Women’s Rights Project., Other experience included work at the General Counsel’s office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and a year of private practice with Bellamy, Blank, Goodman, Kelly, Ross and Stanley., During those years, she also taught early women and the law courses as an adjunct at GW, NYU, Rutgers, and Columbia Law Schools;at GW, she was also a visiting professor., At the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, her litigation resulted in Kentucky women prisoners gaining the right to equal vocational training programs with men and in thousands of Rhode Island mothers receiving more than $2,000,000 to compensate them for the state having denied them the PDA-required paid sick leave other workers received under a Rhode Island statute., Her ACLU Women’s Rights Project litigation helped establish women’s right to equal pension benefits with men, both at the federal trial level (Peters v. Wayne State University in 1979) and Supreme Court (Los Angeles Department of Water &Power v. Manhart in 1978)., While a Hays Civil Liberties Fellow at N.Y.U. Law School, she wrote the ACLU amicus brief for Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., the Supreme Court decision that employers could not refuse to hire mothers –when they hired fathers –of pre-school age children, the Court’s first Title VII sex discrimination case., Before law school, she was a Peace Corps volunteer in Ivory Coast (1965-1967), and her work with the International Women’s Human Rights Clinic has enabled her to work now with many prominent African women’s rights lawyers to advance women’s rights in their countries., Using human rights projects prepared by Clinic students under her leadership, Clinic partners have succeeded in winning new laws prohibiting domestic violence and sex-based employment discrimination in both Ghana and Uganda., In addition, in Ghana, they won new laws prohibiting trafficking and in Uganda, female genital mutilation., Victorious lawsuits in the Uganda Constitutional Court struck down sex-discriminatory laws concerning divorce (husbands could divorce for adultery, but wives could not), criminal adultery (married women could be prosecuted for adultery with an unmarried man, but married men were immune from such prosecution for adultery with an unmarried woman), and inheritance (e.g., intestacy provisions denied the surviving widow, but not the widower, ownership of the matrimonial home and lands;ownership was granted instead to the eldest son)., In Tanzania, the Clinic and the Women’s Legal Aid Centre partnered to win a victory before the U.N.

His background is that of a practicing trial lawyer handling tort, criminal, and commercial litigation. He is author of the books Evidence: Cases, Materials and Problems; Evidence in a Nutshell; Federal Rules of Evidence; Federal Testimonial Privileges and several other books and approximately 100 articles. His numerous professional activities include positions as chair of the American Bar Association Rules of Evidence and Criminal Procedure Committee, Board member and Education Chairman of the Federal Bar Association, chair of the Association of American Law Schools Evidence Section, and consultant to the U.S Congress, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, and the National Academy of Sciences. In addition, he has been a regular contributing editor to the Legal Times, the New York Law Journal, and the Criminal Law Bulletin and on the Publication Advisory Boards of Matthew Bender Co., Lexis-Nexis, and several other publishers. Professor Rothstein was a Fulbright Scholar at Oxford University in England prior to entering the profession.  Professor Rothstein was on the American team helping draft the constitutions of approximately a dozen countries emerging from the former Soviet Union, including Russia. He also was a pioneer in government compensation for victims of crime, helping draft some of the earliest American legislation and playing an instrumental role in the formation of the American and International Crime Victims Compensation Associations, in which he was an officer. He has been a principal consultant to both houses of Congress on revision of the massive U.S. Criminal Code and on the Federal Rules of Evidence; and has advised states, such as Texas, and D.C., on the revision of their criminal codes, and states and countries considering codification of rules of evidence, including New York and Canada. He has trained federal and state judges at the Federal Judicial Center and the National Judicial College, the principal agencies for the education of federal and state judges, respectively. Rothstein also was consultant to the IRS and Treasury Department in the drafting of successful mutual assistance treaties with Switzerland and other countries, providing (for the first time in several instances) much needed cross-border procedures for obtaining testimony and other evidence in criminal cases. He was also consultant on electronic evidence to the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service, as well as to the Georgetown University Project on Scientific Validity and the Courts.  His books and long-running series of articles and conference programs for judges and attorneys on the Federal Rules of Evidence, together with his chairmanship of the Association of American Law Schools Evidence Section and of an American Bar Association Committee studying the Rules, are credited with advancing in a major way professionalism and competence in the use and teaching of the Rules.   He has designed and run trial-lawyer training programs for the Justice Department and other government agencies and leading Washington law firms; and has run a federal public defender service. He has represented prominent public figures, and has been invited to write Friend of the Court briefs in several important Supreme Court cases, including two of the leading evidence cases and a petition for certiorari in a case involving President Bill and Hillary Clinton and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. The Supreme Court has cited his work.  Professor Rothstein is also frequently sought out as a public commentator on many of the important legal developments of our times.

Treanor is the Dean and Executive Vice President of Georgetown University Law Center, and he holds the Law Center’s Paul Regis Dean Leadership Professorship. Dean Treanor joined Georgetown in 2010 and was reappointed to serve a third term beginning July 1, 2020.  Under Treanor’s leadership, Georgetown Law has hired 51 new faculty members; tripled the number of experiential offerings for students in its clinical, externship, and practicum programs; and experienced its most successful era of fundraising, culminating in nearly $56 million in annual giving in 2021.  As dean, Treanor has worked to advance Georgetown Law’s commitment to affordability and access. During his tenure, Georgetown has more than doubled financial aid; raised nearly $20 million dollars for the Law Center’s scholarship program for exceptional students with significant financial need; and launched the RISE program, which provides academic support for students from historically underrepresented groups. The Law Center also created the Early Outreach Initiative which brings the Law Center’s dean of admissions, current law students, and alumni into urban high schools across the country to encourage student interest in pursuing careers as lawyers. Georgetown Law’s motto is “Law is but the means; justice is the end,” and Treanor has focused on increasing opportunities for students to pursue careers in public interest law. The newly-established Blume Public Interest Leaders program provides full tuition scholarships, mentors, and specialized programs to a select group of students who wish to pursue careers in the public interest area. The Law Center has also initiated a program of post-graduate fellowships that have enabled more than 100 graduates to work in public interest jobs, and, in combination with the law firms Arent Fox and DLA Piper, it has launched the DC Affordable Law Firm, a “low bono” law firm where recent Georgetown Law graduates provide legal representation to people of limited means. Dean Treanor has worked to develop Georgetown Law’s world-class program in law and technology. Currently, the Law Center has 15 faculty experts in law and technology and offers 85 courses in this area. During the dean’s tenure, the Law Center has established the Institute for Technology Law & Policy; the Center on Privacy & Technology; the Technology Scholars Program; and the Georgetown Law Technology Review. In 2012, Dean Treanor was recognized by the National Law Journal as a “Champion” because of his work to “uphold the profession’s core values.” In the same year, he received the 2012 David Stoner Uncommon Counselor Award from the David Nee Foundation for his efforts to raise mental health awareness among law students. National Jurist magazine has named him one of the most influential people in legal education four times. He is a member of the Morristown (N.J.) High School Hall of Fame. Most recently, in 2020 he was elected into the American Academy of Arts & Sciences for law and education. Treanor’s areas of academic expertise include constitutional law, property law, criminal law, intellectual property, and legal history. At Georgetown Law, he has taught a first-year legal justice seminar, an upper-level course on the drafting of the U.S. Constitution, and most recently leadership courses. His writings have principally been in the area of constitutional history, and he has been recognized as one of the 10 most-cited legal history scholars in the United States by the University of Chicago Law School’s Brian Leiter. His early work largely focused on the history of constitutional protections of private property. His articles were selected three times by the Land Use and Environment Law Review as among the year’s finest, and his article “The Original Understanding of the Takings Clause and the Political Process,” 95 Colum. L. Rev. 782 (1995), was recently recognized by the Land Use Professors Blog as the most cited land use article of the past 30 years. Treanor’s more recent work, including “Judicial Review before Marbury,” his doctoral dissertation, has focused on the emergence of judicial review and on constitutional interpretation in the early republic. His forthcoming article, “The Case of the Dishonest Scrivener: Gouverneur Morris and the Creation of the Federalist Constitution,” a study of the changes that constitutional convention delegate Gouverneur Morris and the Committee of Style made in preparing the Constitution’s final draft, will be published in the October 2021 issue of the Michigan Law Review.  Before coming to Georgetown, Treanor was Dean and Paul Fuller Professor of Law at Fordham Law School, where he began teaching in 1991. He also has served in a variety of positions in the government, including Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel, U.S. Department of Justice; Associate Counsel, Office of Independent Counsel during the Iran/Contra investigation; Speechwriter to the United States Secretary of Education; Special Assistant U.S. Attorney in the District of Columbia United States Attorney’s Office; and Special Assistant to the Chair of the New York State Commission on Government Integrity. He was law clerk to the Honorable James L. Oakes, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
